# RSIgnal_bot
binance crypro RSI calculator (same as tradingview)

## Overview
This code will calculate RSI according to the TradinView and it will be using Binance API. To Compute RSI and have the near exact number as tradingview, the standard formula has been used :

```
RSI = 100 â€“ 100/ (1 + RS)

RS = Average Gain of n days UP  / Average Loss of n days DOWN
```

RSI  provides a visual mean to monitor both the current, as well as historical, strength and weakness of a particular market. 

The strength or weakness is based on closing prices over the duration of a specified trading period creating a reliable metric of price and momentum changes.

The Partial difference between RSI in small timeframes such as 1minutes in calculated RSI using this code, oppose to tradingview RSI, is because of unmutual starting point for getting RMA (relative moving average).
